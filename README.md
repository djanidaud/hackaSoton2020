# hackaSoton2020
A Smart Recipe Book application. 
My team and I developed the application in under 8 hours at a Hackaton event in Southampton. We had just started learning JavaFX as part of the university's curriculum so this projects was mostly done for educational purposes. We didn't win a prize at the Hackaton, but we definitely learned a great deal about this framework!
